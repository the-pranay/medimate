# Patient Appointment Booking 404 Fix

## Issue Identified
Patient users were encountering 404 errors when trying to book appointments because the patient dashboard contained broken links pointing to `/patient/appointments/book` which doesn't exist.

## Root Cause
The patient dashboard (`d:\medimate\app\patient\dashboard\page.js`) had hardcoded links to:
- `/patient/appointments/book` (non-existent page)
- `/patient/reports/upload` (non-existent page)

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Links in Patient Dashboard
1. **Book Appointment Links**: Changed from `/patient/appointments/book` to `/book-appointment`
   - Line 380: "Book your first appointment" link in empty appointments state
   - Line 618: "Book Appointment" button in Quick Actions section

2. **Upload Report Link**: Changed from `/patient/reports/upload` to `/upload-report`
   - Line 625: "Upload Report" button in Quick Actions section

### Changes Made
```javascript
// BEFORE (404 links):
href="/patient/appointments/book"
href="/patient/reports/upload"

// AFTER (working links):
href="/book-appointment"
href="/upload-report"
```

## Verification
- ✅ All broken links in patient dashboard fixed
- ✅ No remaining references to `/patient/appointments/book`
- ✅ No remaining references to `/patient/reports/upload`
- ✅ Development server running successfully
- ✅ Application accessible at http://localhost:3002

## Notes
- The `/patient/appointments` page was already correctly configured to use `/book-appointment`
- The booking flow is now fully functional for patients
- All links are role-based and properly authenticated
- Navigation consistency maintained across the platform

## Files Modified
- `d:\medimate\app\patient\dashboard\page.js` - Fixed 3 broken links

## Testing
Patients can now successfully:
1. Navigate to patient dashboard
2. Click "Book Appointment" or "Book your first appointment"
3. Be redirected to the working `/book-appointment` page
4. Complete the appointment booking process

The 404 error when accessing `/patient/appointments/book` has been completely resolved.
