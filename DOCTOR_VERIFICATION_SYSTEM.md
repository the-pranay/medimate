# Doctor Verification System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive doctor verification system to ensure only genuine, qualified doctors can access the MediMate platform. This prevents fake doctors from using the platform and maintains patient safety.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Doctor Registration Flow
- **Registration Process**: Doctors can register but their accounts are set to `isVerified: false` by default
- **Enhanced Messaging**: Registration success message informs doctors about pending verification
- **Required Fields**: Doctors must provide license number, specialization, and experience

### 2. Authentication & Access Control
- **Login Verification**: Unverified doctors cannot access the platform after login
- **Dashboard Protection**: All doctor pages check verification status before loading
- **Automatic Redirection**: Unverified doctors are redirected to verification pending page

### 3. Admin Verification Panel
- **Admin Dashboard**: Added "Verify Doctors" link in Quick Actions
- **Verification Interface**: Comprehensive page to review pending doctor applications
- **Approval Actions**: Admin can approve or reject doctor applications
- **Rejection Reasons**: Optional reason field for rejections
- **Real-time Updates**: Status updates reflected immediately

### 4. Doctor Verification Status Pages
- **Pending Page**: Dedicated page for doctors awaiting verification
- **Status Check**: Button to check verification status
- **Application Details**: Shows submitted information for review
- **Professional UI**: Clean, medical-themed interface

### 5. Database Schema Updates
- **Verification Fields**: Added `verifiedBy`, `verifiedAt`, `rejectedBy`, `rejectedAt`, `rejectionReason`
- **Audit Trail**: Track who verified/rejected doctors and when
- **Status Tracking**: Complete verification history

## Technical Implementation

2. **`/doctor/verification-pending`** - Doctor pending verification page

### Security Features
