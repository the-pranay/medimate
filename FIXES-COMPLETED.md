# MediMate - All Issues Fixed Summary

## âœ… FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. **Logout Functionality Fixed**
- **Issue**: Logout not clearing authToken from localStorage
- **Fix**: Updated `handleLogout` functions in both doctor and patient dashboards to clear all authentication data:
  - `localStorage.removeItem('userRole')`
  - `localStorage.removeItem('token')`
  - `localStorage.removeItem('authToken')`
  - `localStorage.removeItem('user')`
  - `localStorage.removeItem('isAuthenticated')`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `d:\medimate\app\doctor-dashboard\page.js`
  - `d:\medimate\app\patient-dashboard\page.js`
  - `d:\medimate\app\components\ui\DashboardNavbar.js`

### 2. **Profile and Settings Buttons Made Functional**
- **Issue**: Profile and Settings buttons not routing to correct pages
- **Fix**: Updated `DashboardNavbar.js` to route to role-specific pages:
  - Doctor Profile: `/doctor-dashboard/profile`
  - Doctor Settings: `/doctor-dashboard/settings`
  - Patient Profile: `/patient-dashboard/profile`
  - Patient Settings: `/patient-dashboard/settings`
- **Files Created**:
  - `d:\medimate\app\patient-dashboard\settings\page.js`
  - `d:\medimate\app\doctor-dashboard\settings\page.js`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `d:\medimate\app\components\ui\DashboardNavbar.js`

### 3. **Profile Text Visibility Fixed**
- **Issue**: Text not visible in profile information and profile update pages
- **Fix**: Updated profile pages to not rely on AuthContext and use proper authentication:
  - Replaced `useAuth()` with direct localStorage access
  - Added proper loading states
  - Added error handling for missing user data
- **Files Modified**:
  - `d:\medimate\app\patient-dashboard\profile\page.js`
  - `d:\medimate\app\doctor-dashboard\profile\page.js`
  - `d:\medimate\app\components\ui\ProfileEdit.js`

### 4. **Appointment Booking Fixed**
- **Issue**: "Failed to create appointment" error during booking
- **Fix**: Already fixed in previous sessions:
  - Proper appointment type mapping (`typeMapping`)
  - Fixed Razorpay payment order creation
  - Correct appointment data structure
- **Files Previously Modified**:
  - `d:\medimate\app\book-appointment\page.js`
  - `d:\medimate\app\api\appointments\route.js`
  - `d:\medimate\app\api\payments\create-order\route.js`

### 5. **Appointment Status Updates**
- **Issue**: Appointment status not updating correctly across patient and doctor dashboards
- **Fix**: Verified that appointment status updates work correctly:
  - Patient creates appointment â†’ Status: "scheduled"
  - After payment â†’ Status: "scheduled" (ready for doctor confirmation)
  - Doctor confirms â†’ Status: "confirmed"
  - Both patient and doctor can see status updates in their dashboards
- **Files Verified**:
  - `d:\medimate\app\api\appointments\[id]\status\route.js`
  - Dashboard appointment display logic
