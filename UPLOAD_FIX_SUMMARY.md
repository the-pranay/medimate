# 🔧 Upload Functionality Fix Summary

## ✅ **Issue RESOLVED**: EROFS Read-Only File System Error

### **Original Problem**
```
Failed to upload photo: Internal server error: EROFS: read-only file system, open '/var/task/public/uploads/profiles/68680827a2ee5bfbb1050584_1751
```

### **Root Cause**
The application was attempting to save uploaded files to the local filesystem (`public/uploads/`) which is **read-only** in serverless environments like Vercel.

### **Solution Implemented**
✅ **Migrated to Cloudinary Cloud Storage**

## 📋 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Dependencies**
- ✅ Installed `cloudinary` package
- ✅ Updated environment variables

### 2. **API Endpoints Updated**
- ✅ `/api/users/upload-photo/route.js` - Profile photo uploads
- ✅ `/api/medical-records/upload/route.js` - Medical report uploads

### 3. **File Structure**
```
Before: /public/uploads/profiles/filename.jpg
After:  https://res.cloudinary.com/medimate/image/upload/profile-pictures/filename.jpg
```

### 4. **Environment Variables**
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=MediMate
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=983787379882886
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=pLrz-1yFVLhg2n0OheWihItNsMw
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=MediMate
```

## 🚀 **Benefits of Cloudinary Integration**

| Feature | Local Filesystem | Cloudinary |
|---------|------------------|------------|

4. **Database** stores Cloudinary URL
5. **Client** receives secure URL

## 🛡️ **Security Features**
