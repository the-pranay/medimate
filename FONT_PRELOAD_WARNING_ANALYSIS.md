# Font Preload Warning Fix

## Issue Description
The console is showing font preload warnings:
```
The resource at "https://new-medimate.vercel.app/_next/static/media/569ce4b8f30dc480-s.p.woff2" preloaded with link preload was not used within a few seconds.
```

## Root Cause
These warnings occur when Next.js preloads fonts that are not immediately used on the page. This is a common optimization issue and does not affect functionality.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Disable Font Preloading (Recommended)
Add to `next.config.js`:
```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    optimizeFonts: false,
  },
  // Or alternatively:
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.resolve.fallback = {
      ...config.resolve.fallback,
      fs: false,
    };
    return config;
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

### Option 2: Custom Font Loading
Create a custom `_document.js` file in the `app` directory to control font loading:
```javascript
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head>
        {/* Only preload fonts that are actually used */}
        <link
          rel="preload"
          href="/fonts/your-font.woff2"
          as="font"
          type="font/woff2"
          crossOrigin="anonymous"
        />
      </Head>
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

### Option 3: Ignore the Warnings
These are just performance warnings and do not affect functionality. They can be safely ignored in development.

## Status
✅ **Infinite reload issue is FIXED** - The warnings are unrelated to the reload problem
✅ **All functionality working** - Appointments, prescriptions, reports all functional
⚠️ **Font warnings are cosmetic** - Performance optimization, not a blocking issue

## Recommendation
Since the application is working correctly and the warnings are just optimization suggestions, you can either:
1. Ignore the warnings (they don't affect functionality)
2. Implement Option 1 above to disable font preloading
3. Wait for Next.js to optimize font loading in future versions

The infinite reload issue has been completely resolved and is not related to these font warnings.
