# Upload Functionality Fix - Cloudinary Integration

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: `EROFS: read-only file system, open '/var/task/public/uploads/profiles/...` error when uploading doctor images (or any files).

**Root Cause**: The application was trying to save uploaded files to the local filesystem (`public/uploads/`), but in serverless environments like Vercel, the filesystem is read-only.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Cloudinary Integration
- **Replaced** local filesystem uploads with **Cloudinary** cloud storage
- **Installed** `cloudinary` package: `npm install cloudinary`
- **Updated** environment variables with Cloudinary credentials

### 2. Files Modified

#### Profile Photo Upload API (`/api/users/upload-photo/route.js`)
```javascript
// BEFORE (filesystem)
import { writeFile, mkdir } from 'fs/promises';
await writeFile(filePath, buffer);
const profilePictureUrl = `/uploads/profiles/${uniqueFilename}`;

// AFTER (Cloudinary)
import { uploadFileToCloudinary } from '../../../../lib/cloudinary';
const uploadResult = await uploadFileToCloudinary(buffer, uniqueFilename, 'profile-pictures');
const profilePictureUrl = uploadResult.url;
```

#### Medical Records Upload API (`/api/medical-records/upload/route.js`)
```javascript
// BEFORE (filesystem)
import { writeFile, mkdir } from 'fs/promises';
await writeFile(filepath, buffer);
fileUrl: `/uploads/medical-reports/${filename}`

// AFTER (Cloudinary)
import { uploadFileToCloudinary } from '../../../../lib/cloudinary';
const uploadResult = await uploadFileToCloudinary(buffer, filename, 'medical-reports');
fileUrl: uploadResult.url
```

### 3. Environment Variables Added
```env
# Cloud Storage (Cloudinary)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=MediMate
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=983787379882886
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=pLrz-1yFVLhg2n0OheWihItNsMw
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=MediMate
```

### 4. Benefits of Cloudinary Integration
- ✅ **Scalable**: No server storage limitations
- ✅ **Reliable**: Professional cloud storage service
- ✅ **Fast**: Global CDN for file delivery
- ✅ **Secure**: Built-in security features
- ✅ **Compatible**: Works in all deployment environments

## Testing

### Browser-Based Test
Open: `http://localhost:3001/test-upload-fix.html`

### API Endpoints Updated
- **Profile Photos**: `POST /api/users/upload-photo`
- **Medical Records**: `POST /api/medical-records/upload`

### Test Results Expected
- ✅ No more `EROFS` errors
- ✅ Files uploaded to Cloudinary
- ✅ URLs returned as `https://res.cloudinary.com/...`
- ✅ Works in all environments (local, serverless, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### Upload Process Flow
1. **File Validation**: Size, type, and format checks
2. **Buffer Conversion**: Convert file to buffer for Cloudinary
3. **Cloud Upload**: Upload to Cloudinary with organized folders
4. **Database Update**: Store Cloudinary URL in database
5. **Response**: Return secure Cloudinary URL to client

### Error Handling
- **File validation** before upload
- **Upload failure** fallback
- **Database update** verification
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging

### Security Features
- **JWT Authentication** required for uploads
- **File type validation** (images, PDFs only)
- **File size limits** (5MB profiles, 10MB reports)
- **Secure Cloudinary URLs** with access controls

## Deployment Notes

### Production Configuration
1. Update Cloudinary credentials in production environment
2. Set up Cloudinary upload presets if needed
3. Configure CDN settings for optimal performance
4. Monitor upload quotas and usage

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Profile photo upload works for all user types
- [ ] Medical report upload works for patients
- [ ] No filesystem errors in logs
- [ ] Cloudinary URLs are properly formatted
- [ ] File validation works correctly
- [ ] Error handling provides useful feedback

## Conclusion

The upload functionality has been successfully migrated from local filesystem to Cloudinary cloud storage. This resolves the `EROFS: read-only file system` error and provides a more robust, scalable solution for file uploads in the MediMate application.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - All upload functionality now uses Cloudinary cloud storage.
