# Doctor Verification System - Final Status

## ✅ System Status: OPERATIONAL

### ✅ Dynamic Route Issue: RESOLVED
- The conflict between `[doctorId]` and `[id]` route parameters has been completely fixed
- Removed the conflicting `[id]` folder from `app/api/admin/doctors/`
- Cleared Next.js cache to resolve any cached route conflicts
- Server now starts without any errors on both standard and Turbopack modes

### ✅ Build Issues: RESOLVED
- Font resolution error with Turbopack has been resolved
- Server runs successfully with `npm run dev` (Turbopack enabled)
- Alternative: Server also runs with `npx next dev` (standard mode)
- Both modes are now operational and conflict-free

### Manual Testing Guide

The system is now ready for end-to-end manual testing:

1. **Doctor Registration:**
   - Register as a doctor at `/register`
   - Verify the success message indicates verification is required
   - Check database to confirm `isVerified: false`

2. **Unverified Doctor Login:**
   - Attempt to login with unverified doctor credentials
   - Verify you're redirected to pending verification page
   - Confirm you cannot access the dashboard

3. **Admin Verification:**
   - Login as an admin
   - Go to `/admin/doctors/verify`
   - Verify the pending doctor appears in the list
   - Test both approval and rejection

4. **Post-Verification:**
   - After approving, login as the doctor
   - Verify you can now access all features
   - Check database for verification audit trail

## Next Steps

1. **Automated Testing:**
   - Update test strings in `test-verification-system.js` to match actual implementation
   - Add API integration tests

2. **Optional Enhancements:**
