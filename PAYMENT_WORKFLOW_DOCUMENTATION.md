# Payment-to-Appointment Workflow Documentation

## 🎯 Overview
This document describes the complete payment-to-appointment workflow in the MediMate healthcare platform, from payment verification to doctor confirmation.

## 📋 Workflow Steps

### 1. Patient Books Appointment
- Patient selects doctor and books appointment
- Appointment created with status: `pending`
- Payment gateway initiated (Razorpay)

### 2. Payment Processing
- Patient completes payment via Razorpay
- Payment verification API called: `POST /api/payments/verify`
- Upon successful verification:
  - Payment details saved to appointment
  - Appointment status updated to: `paid`
  - Patient receives confirmation

### 3. Doctor Confirmation
- Doctor views appointments in dashboard
- Appointments with `paid` status show:
  - "Payment Confirmed" badge
  - Payment details (amount, transaction ID, date)
  - "Confirm Appointment" button
- Doctor clicks confirm button
- API called: `PATCH /api/appointments/[id]/status`
- Appointment status updated to: `confirmed`
- Confirmation timestamp and doctor ID recorded

### 4. Status Updates
- Both patient and doctor dashboards update in real-time
- Patient sees progression from "Payment Confirmed" to "Confirmed"
- Complete audit trail maintained
